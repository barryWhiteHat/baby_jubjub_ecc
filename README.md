This repository contains zksnark constarint systems for [twisted edwards curve](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/baby_jubjub) 
point addition, point multiplication, eddsa signature verification and pedersen commitments. As well as python scripts for
test case generation. 

This is a naive implmentaion and considerable optimizations are possible. 

## build instructions:

### build libsnark gadget and getting the proving key
get dependencies `git submodule update --init --recursive`
`mkdir build` 
`cd build`
`cmake .. && make`

### Running the tests
Start your preferred ethereum node, `cd tests` and run `python3 test*` will generate all the 
test variables that you can confirm in `src/main.cpp`

You can run the test after building by 
```
cd build
./src/main
```
